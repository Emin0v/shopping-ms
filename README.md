# Shopping API Microservice Architecture

This project contains a microservice architecture for a shopping application simulator.

## Understanding this project

This project was developed as a proof of concept for achieve two main goals. The first one is to demonstrate that it is possible to build a microservice architecture using both decentralized and shared databases.

The second goal is to implement a DevOps approach to build a set of Spring Boot microservices inside a docker container and use them by another container.

The third goal is to provide security and logging in the microservice architecture

## Getting started
